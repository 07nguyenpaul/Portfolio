    <h3>Project 1: Guess What Number I'm Thinking Of...</h3>
    <img src="photos/numbers.jpg" alt="project-1" />
    <p>
      This was my first project at Turing. I collaborated with Peter Springer and we
      created a Number Guessing game. Starting out the program generates a random number
      from 1 to 100 and it's the gamers job to guess it right. The program also assists the gamer
      with helpful hints on guessing higher or lower. If the gamer gets it correct, the game
      generates another number but the min and max ranges decreases and increases by 10.
      <br>
      <br>
      In order for this game to work, we used HTML to created everything we need. We also used
      CSS to add our own creativity in styling the game. Lastly, we used JavaScript to tie everything
      together in order for it to work properly. There were plenty of trial and error issues but we're
      stoked on how everything turned out. "
