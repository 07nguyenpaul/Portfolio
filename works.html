      <h4>Project 1: Guess What Number I'm Thinking Of...</h4>
      <img src="photos/numbers.jpg" alt="project-1" />
      <p>
        This was my first project at Turing. I collaborated with Peter Springer and we
        created a Number Guessing game. Starting out the program generates a random number
        from 1 to 100 and it's the gamers job to guess it right. The program also assists the gamer
        with helpful hints on guessing higher or lower. If the gamer gets it correct, the game
        generates another number but the min and max ranges decreases and increases by 10.
        <br>
        <br>
        In order for this game to work, we used HTML to created everything we need. We also used
        CSS to add our own creativity in styling the game. Lastly, we used JavaScript to tie everything
        together in order for it to work properly. There were plenty of trial and error issues but we're
        stoked on how everything turned out. "

      <h4>Project 2: Bookmark List</h4>
      <img src="photos/BookmarkList.jpg" alt="project-2" />
      <p>
        In this project I collaborated with MaryJane Valade and we created a Bookmark List program to test
        our jquery skills. We created a program that receives 2 inputs, a title and URL. The code
        specifies that the user has to input a valid URL in order to save it to the list. The program has
        another feature that enables the user to highlight certain bookmarks and the program records whether
        it has been read or not. Also, it allows the user to remove bookmarks while updating the application
        that records read, unread, and total amount of bookmarks listed.

      <h4>Project 3: Color Changer</h4>
      <img src="photos/color-changer.jpg" alt="project-3" />
      <p>
        This project was our first single day project. The goal for this project was to
        generate a random color, !=white, that changes the background color of the screen.
        It only required 2 buttons, one randomizes the colors and one that resets the
        background color back to white. The buttons also had a unique specifications on styling. Not
        only did this project test us on our CSS but our JavaScript as well.

      <h4>Project 4: Idea Box</h4>
      <img src="photos/IdeaBox.jpg" alt="project-4" />
      <p>
        In this project I collaborated with Mike Sausa and we learned about keeping 'server' and 'client'
        as separate entities. We used JSON and localStorage to store and regenerate ideas inside localStorage.
        We created a code to hold ideas inside of an array of objects with four attributes: an unique id,
        title, body and quality ranking. We also enabled a feature that lets the user edit any idea
        and it would update their localStorage until they removed it. That unique id is hard
        coded to that specific idea, and we used it to update any changes made to it's title, body,
        or ranking quality. It was also used to find and display any idea that user is trying to
        find using the search bar.

      <h4>Project 5: Snake</h4>
      <img src="photos/snake.jpg" alt="project-5" />
      <p>
        For game time Casey Cross and I decided to make Snake! üêç We used jquery, mocha, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
        The goal was not only to design but test the implementations of our code. Everyone knows how the game works
        but there are several parts to designing the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        We first had to render a snake on a canvas and make it
        move. The next step was to generate food for the snake to eat, but generate it in different locations of
        the canvas that the snake does not occupy. Next we had to make the snake grew when the food was eaten.
        This was a the tricky part of the design because each segment of the snake has to follow the piece in front
        of it. If not, the snake wouldn't zig and zag. Lastly, we had to create code to end the game based on if the
        snake hits a wall or runs into itself.
